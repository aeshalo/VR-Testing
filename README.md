Messing about in VR

Scripts of some note:

CutTestScript: this cuts a gameObject with a mesh into two distinct objects along a to-be-supplied plane.
This recreates the feeling of chopping something into two bits.
NOTE: a video of this working is available in Videos

HoverDummyScript: this script implements a physical, PID-Based Control system to 'animate' a hovering training dummy drone.
This allows the dummy's sword strkes to be parried and interacted with in a physics based, 'realistic' way, rather than pre-canned animations, with no interactivity.
NOTE: a video of this working is available in Videos

SwishTrail: this script dynamically generates a textured mesh behind the player's Sword, approximating the 'swish' effect seen in films, games and comic books.

WeissSword: this implements the player's various attacks. Work in Progress.
